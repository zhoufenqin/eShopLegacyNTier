## Supported Task Patterns

The following are the task patterns supported by the modernize CLI. These patterns are used to identify the modernization tasks that need to be performed based on the user's input.

The patterns are categorized into two groups, and they should be treated differently if picked:

* Patterns with skill definitions: These patterns have pre-defined skills that can be used to execute the tasks. If a task matches one of these patterns, the corresponding skill should be used in the task plan.
* Patterns without skill definitions: These patterns do not have pre-defined skills. If a task matches one of these patterns, the description should be used to guide the AI in performing the required tasks.
   **IMPORTANT**: The pattern name should NEVER be used as the skill name in the generated plan and tasks.json. They are meant to guide the task generation, not to be directly used as skills.


### Task Patterns with Skill Definitions
These patterns have pre-defined skills to assist in their execution. When they are selected in a modernization plan, the corresponding skills should be used.
Each of the item is written in the following format: `- **skill-name**: skill-description`.

- **infrastructure-bicep-generation**: Generate Bicep IaC files for Azure infrastructure provisioning

- **migration-mi-mysql-azure-sdk-public-cloud**: Migrate from MySQL to Azure Database for MySQL with Azure SDK and managed identity for secure, credential-free authentication.
- **migration-mi-postgresql-azure-sdk-21v-china**: Migrate from PostgreSQL to Azure Database for PostgreSQL with Azure SDK and managed identity in the Mooncake cloud for secure, credential-free authentication.
- **migration-mi-postgresql-azure-sdk-public-cloud**: Migrate from PostgreSQL to Azure Database for PostgreSQL with Azure SDK and managed identity for secure, credential-free authentication.
- **migration-on-premises-user-authentication-to-microsoft-entra-id**: Migrate the user authentication to Microsoft Entra ID authentication
- **migration-oracle-coherence-to-azure-cache-for-redis**: Migrate from Oracle Coherence distributed cache to Azure Cache for Redis.
- **migration-oracle-to-postgresql**: Migrate from Oracle DB to PostgreSQL

- **migration-spring-jms-rabbitmq-servicebus**: Migrate from RabbitMQ with JMS to Azure Service Bus for a managed messaging service with JMS API support.

### Task Patterns without Skill Definitions
These patterns DO NOT have pre-defined skills. The pattern name and description define the modernization scenario, NOT A SKILL. They are in the format of `- **pattern-name**: pattern-description`.

A pattern should be selected if it matches one of the customer's requirements, and there are no skills supporting this requirement.

**IMPORTANT**:
- NEVER write the pattern name as skill name in the generated plan.
- Tasks generated from these patterns must have NO skill assigned. Do not reuse any skill from the "Task Patterns with Skill Definitions" section, even if a skill targets a similar technology or appears related.
